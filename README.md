# Yogi Track 

Check it out at [yogi-track](https://yoga-capstone.now.sh/).

Yogi Track is a Full-Stack mobile first responsive web application for yoga teachers and enthusiasts helping a user to explore and learn avariety of poses, providing an english and sanskrit name for each pose with alphabetic sort based on either. The user can then create an account where he/she can save poses into yoga-flows as inspirations for a class or record of personal practice with notes and personal rating system.

## WHY MAKE THIS APP?
As a yoga teacher I find myself constatly googling the correct asana's names in sanskrit (there is way over 200 poses in yoga and to learn their complex sanskrit names takes time) and making lists of poses as part of my preperation before teaching a class. This app is meant to be a tool to help memorize sanskrit names, streamline class planning process and help teachers advance their skills.
